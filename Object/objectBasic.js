/*In JavaScript, objects start with a open curly-brace { and end with a close curly-brace }. We can put key-value pairs in between these braces.

Let's take a look at a simple object:
*/
const team = {
    name: "Mets",
    wins: 86,
    inPlayoffs: false,
};
const order = {
    pizzas: 3,
    extraCheese: true,
    deliveryInstructions: "Round the back, please!",
};

module.exports = order;
/*
In this object team, we have three keys: name, wins and inPlayoffs 

The value associated with name is "Mets", with wins is 86 and with inPlayoffs is false 
*/
