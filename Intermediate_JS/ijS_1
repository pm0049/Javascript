Logical OR
There are cases in code where we want to say "this condition" or "this other condition". If either of the conditions are true, let's do something!

It would be quite ugly to write this with if statements every time:

if(car) {
    driveToAirport();
}
else if(motorcycle) {
    driveToAirport();
}
else if(truck) {
    driveToAirport();
}
If we needed to change the driveToAirport function, we would have to change it in 3 places.
