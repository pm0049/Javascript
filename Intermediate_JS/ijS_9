JavaScript Errors
There are many errors that can be thrown by the JavaScript language itself.

Here's an example of an error thrown by JavaScript:

const x = 3;

x();
In this example, x is a number and cannot be invoked! This will throw a TypeError.

 There are several different types of errors thrown by JavaScript: TypeError, ReferenceError, SyntaxError, and RangeError. You can learn about these different types of errors and the situations in which they occur in details.
