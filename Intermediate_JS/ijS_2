Default Operator
In the last stage we referred to || as the Logical OR operator.

This operator is also sometimes referred to as the default operator, due to its behavior with truthy and falsey values.

Take, for example:

console.log("" || "Something Else"); // Something Else
The empty string "" is a falsey value, so || will take the second value in this operation.

This can be pretty useful with variables! We can use this to create a default message if one is not defined:

const message = WELCOME_MESSAGE || "Hello there!";
 Here message is guaranteed a truthy value even if WELCOME_MESSAGE is empty.

And it's not just limited to empty strings either:

const age = user.age || 99;
 If user.age is undefined or 0 we will default to 99. For that matter user.age could be any falsey value and it would default to 99.
