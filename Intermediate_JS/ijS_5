NOT Operator
The final logical operator we will discuss is the ! operator. Commonly referred to as the NOT or negation operator.

This operator will flip true and false:

console.log(!true); // false
console.log(!false); // true
It will also flip truthy and falsey values:

console.log(!2); // false
console.log(!undefined); // true
 If you apply the negation operator to a truthy or falsey value twice, you'll wind up with the corresponding boolean value. Since 2 is a truthy value, !!2 will evaluate to true.
